#define NPC_DESCRIPTION "It looks like a man dressed up in rags, covering the body almost completely, but nothing else can be seen apart from the cloth."

#define NPC_INTRO "Oh so you're the one who got inside the house eh? For a second i thought my creator finally came back \
to finish the job... Alas my hopes were for naught, heheh. Hmm? Oh i see how it is, you fell for the old man's childish 'traps', eh? \
Well that's too bad, you need the antidote but searching for it amongst all these bottles you will surely die before finding it\
what a shame, heheheh... unless... unless you help me out. I've been with him long enough to know his art, so i can tell you which one is the antidote."

#define NPC_RIDDLE_START "These shackles were enchanted by him, the key to each one of these is a specific word, naturally i would have gotten rid of these quite soon if it\
wasn't for him putting a curse that prevents me from uttering those words, even worse he forbade the use of other methods that prevent me from outright tell anybody \
the answer straightaway... So! I came up with riddles in order to bypass these, what do say, deal?... Oh before you say anything, say the wrong answer and the wards on these \
will kill you faster than the poison."

#define RIDDLE_1 "First riddle: I am what remains when the warmth is gone. I am left behind when the light goes out. I leave a mark on whatever I touch, and the wind can wipe me away. What am I?"

#define RIDDLE_3 "Third riddle: I can be given but not traded or sold. I cannot be stolen or paid for in gold. The poor and the rich alike yearn for me, a gift still treasured when the giver is but a memory."

#define RIDDLE_3_RESPONSES "1. Forgiveness, 2. Kindness, 3. Beauty"

#define END_DIALOGUE "So much better! I can finally get rid of these damned things!! \
... ahhh so much time, so many things to do, and many paybacks i have\
to check from my list, heheheh ... Huh? You are still alive? Well, I'm\
on a great mood, so here's your precious antidote, I'm out of here before\
my mood shifts and I set fire to this house and everything inside it.\

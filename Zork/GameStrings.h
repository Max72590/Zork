				   For a second i thought my creator finally came back\
				   to finish the job... Alas my hopes were for naught, heheh.\
				   Hmm? Oh i see how it is, you fell for the old man's childish\
				   'traps', eh? Well that's too bad, you need the antidote but\
					searching for it amongst all these bottles you will surely die before finding it\
					what a shame, heheheh... unless... unless you help me out. I've been with him\
					long enough to know his art, so i can tell you which one is the antidote."

#define NPC_RIDDLE_START "These shackles were enchanted by him, the key to each one of these is\
						a specific word, naturally i would have gotten rid of these quite soon if it\
						wasn't for him putting a curse that prevents me from uttering those words, even \
						worse he forbade the use of other methods that prevent me from outright tell anybody \
						the answer straightaway... So! I came up with riddles in order to bypass these, what do\
						say, deal?... Oh before you say anything, say the wrong answer and the wards on these \
						will kill you faster than the poison."

#define RIDDLE_1 "I am what remains when the warmth is gone. I am left behind when the light goes out. I leave a mark on whatever I touch, and the wind can wipe me away. What am I?"

#define END_DIALOGUE "So much better! I can finally get rid of these damned things!! \
					... wow so much time, so many things to do, and many paybacks i have\
					to check from my list, heheheh ... Huh? You are still alive? Well, I'm\
					on a great mood, so here's your precious antidote, I'm out of here before\
					my mood shifts again and I set fire to this house and everything inside it.\
					Toodles!... Oh and don't you dare to meet me again in the future!"
